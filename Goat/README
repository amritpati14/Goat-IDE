README for building of Scintilla and Goat

Scintilla can be built by itself.
To build Goat, Scintilla must first be built.


*** GTK+/Linux version ***

You must first have GTK+ 2.0 or later and GCC (4.1 or better) installed.
GTK+ 1.x will not work.
Other C++ compilers may work but may require tweaking the make file.

To build Scintilla, use the makefile located in the scintilla/gtk directory
	cd scintilla/gtk
	make
	cd ../..

To build and install Goat, use the makefile located in the scite/gtk directory
	cd Goat/gtk
	make
	make install

This installs Goat into $prefix/bin. The value of $prefix is determined from
the location of Gnome if it is installed. This is usually /usr if installed
with Linux or /usr/local if built from source. If Gnome is not installed
/usr/bin is used as the prefix. The prefix can be overridden on the command
line like "make prefix=/opt" but the same value should be used for both make
and make install as this location is compiled into the executable. The global
properties file is installed at $prefix/share/goat/properties/GoatGlobal.properties.
The language specific properties files are also installed into this directory.

To remove Goat
	make uninstall

To clean the object files which may be needed to change $prefix
	make clean

The current make file only supports static linking between Goat and Scintilla.


*** Windows version ***

A C++ compiler is required. Visual Studio .NET 2008 is the development system
used for most development although TDM Mingw32 4.4.1 is also supported.

To build Scintilla, make in the scintilla/win32 directory
		cd scintilla\win32
GCC:		mingw32-make
VS .NET:	nmake -f scintilla.mak
		cd ..\..

To build Goat, use the makefiles located in the Goat/win32 directory
		cd Goat\win32
GCC:		mingw32-make
VS .NET: 	nmake -f Goat.mak

An executable Goat will now be in Goat\bin.

*** GTK+/Windows version ***

Mingw32 is known to work. Other compilers will probably not work.

Only Scintilla will build with GTK+ on Windows. Goat will not work.

To build Scintilla, make in the scintilla/gtk directory
	cd scintilla\gtk
	mingw32-make
