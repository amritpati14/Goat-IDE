<h3>
I created "Goat" as a personal contribution to the free software in the hope that it will be useful to those,
  passionate as me about microcontrollers and embedded systems, do not want (or can not) spend money on commercial software.<br /><br />
My goal is make it grow in the wake of the suggestions of those who will use.<br /><br />
Use it and please send tips, comments and suggestions ...<br /><br />
</h3>

Some features:<br /> <br />

<ul>
<li> Its editor (based on the wonderful library "scintilla" http://www.scintilla.org/), is lightweight and powerful. </li>
<br />
<li> Has additional features such as "syntax highlighting", "code folding" and "code completion" based on the eLua API.</li>
<br />
<li> Includes the capability to connect with the real hardware (through the serial or the USB port) obtaining the prompt of Elua inside it.</li>
<br />
<li> It's able to send the .lua/.lc  file on the Hardware (using the eLua xmodem protocol).</li>
<br />
<li> Supports some terminal commands (standard ansi/vt100), so it's able to play games like "hanoi" or "hungman" (using the eLua TERM capability).</li>
<br />
<li> Supports the FLASH (on the target) programming through the DFU boot loader (initially only for the avr32 architecure).</li>
<br />
<li> It's easily extensible through Lua scripts.</li>
<br />
<li> Almost everything that <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html" target="body">SciTE</a> is able to do.</li>
<br />
</ul>
